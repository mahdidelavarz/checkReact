    term: "Daddy Check Test is a smartphone-based personal test that not only reports sperm count and sperm count, but also shows a live video of your sperm along with sperm count and count. In normal intercourse, only one moving sperm can be transferred to the egg, so it is important to test the \"ability\" of the moving sperm. It's easy to work with daddy Check.Then place the daddy check gadget on your phone and enter the slide. daddy Check captures a video of sperm and then analyzes it to determine how much sperm you have and how you move. Before you get started, you can see what the process is like or read the instructions provided.\nPlease note that Rubit is a smartphone-based home sperm test that provides a quantitative and qualitative assessment of sperm count and their motility based on the WHO standard on human sperm.",
